It's intended for both traditional front-end developers moving from websites to the larger world of web applications, as well as native\/rich internet application developers who are looking to transfer their skills to these up-and-coming technologies.\nThere are already great HTML5 and JavaScript groups in New York so we're hoping to do something a little different. Instead of a single large presentation per event, we'll be trying to do two 30&ndash;45min informal talks where we'll be able to focus more on code than slides. The intention is that events will be a lot less formal and will encourage attendees to share their thoughts and experience with the rest of the group.\nWe'll try to mix up talks every event so they'll be content for both people approaching the platform and for experienced front-end engineers wondering how traditional techniques such as design patterns and tools make sense in this brave new JavaScript world.\nWe're only just getting started, so if you have any thoughts or suggestions please get in touch. Also, if you're interesting in sponsoring the group in any capacity, we'd love to hear from you.","name":"The New York HTML5 Application Developers Group","members":"142","lat":"40.72999954223633","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"10003","lon":"-73.98999786376953","join_info":"None","photo_url":"","group_urlname":"html5-app-developers","organizer_name":"David Padbury","short_link":"","country":"us","topics":[{"id":"417","urlkey":"webstandards","name":"Web Standards"},{"id":"1973","urlkey":"css","name":"CSS"},{"id":"3833","urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Developers"},{"id":"7029","urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript"},{"id":"9696","urlkey":"newtech","name":"New Technology"},{"id":"9886","urlkey":"ria","name":"Rich Internet Applications"},{"id":"10209","urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology"},{"id":"15582","urlkey":"web-development","name":"Web Development"},{"id":"16325","urlkey":"software-engineering","name":"Software Engineering"},{"id":"17627","urlkey":"programming","name":"Programming"},{"id":"56555","urlkey":"javascript-libraries","name":"JavaScript Libraries"},{"id":"78565","urlkey":"html5","name":"HTML5"},{"id":"85951","urlkey":"javascript-frameworks","name":"JavaScript Frameworks"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/11190843\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/nyc-node-js\/","state":"NY","organizer_id":"3274357","join_mode":"0","city":"New York","who":"Developers","id":"2548202","created":"Mon Sep 26 17:36:52 EDT 2011","updated":"Tue Oct 04 11:02:26 EDT 2011","description":"Node.js is event-driven server-side JavaScript running on V8.
